# DatingPlatform
Console app simulating dating platform. 

Pure C project, that stores the data in files. The app allows the
user to create a new account with personal information as well
as add an unlimited number of questions with answers, that
other users can attempt to answer and accumulate personal
points.
I used structures, memory management, file input/output,
operations with linked list - add, delete, create, remove.
